  Esse √© um projeto full-stack que conta com funcionalidades para filtrar partidas por classifica√ß√£o geral dos time da casa ou do time advers√°rio, e filtrar partidas que est√£o em progresso ou finalizadas, tamb√©m conta com a cria√ß√£o de partidas, altera√ß√£o do placar de partidas em andamento feitas por administradores, ocorrendo assim a diferencia√ß√£o de usu√°rios e administradores, entre outras fun√ß√µes.

  <h3>Status do Projeto</h3>
  
    Finalizado ‚úÖüöÄ

<details>
    <summary><strong>Cr√©ditos</strong></summary>
    
    O Front-end foi feito pela equipe de devs da Trybe, para agilizar no tempo de realiza√ß√£o do projeto pelo aluno, mas isso apenas acontece pois compreendemos a estrutura do React e a l√≥gica realizada nesse projeto!

    <summary><strong>Documenta√ß√£o</strong></summary>
    
    A documenta√ß√£o da API est√° dispon√≠vel no site do Postman. Para acessar a documenta√ß√£o, siga estes passos:

  - Acesse a <a href="https://www.postman.com/veronica-alves/trybe-futebol-clube/api/3555f031-b7a9-47d9-99b7-87e89ecbd0f5/documentation/21412246-9a1effb2-15df-4964-a3b5-167436fb9e03">documenta√ß√£o</a>.
  - Se voc√™ n√£o tiver uma conta no Postman, ser√° necess√°rio criar uma para acess√°-la.
  - Depois de acessar a documenta√ß√£o, revise as solicita√ß√µes, corpos e respostas para entender melhor como usar a API.

<details>
    <summary><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Configura√ß√µes m√≠nimas para execu√ß√£o do projeto</strong></summary><br />

Na sua m√°quina voc√™ deve ter:

 - Sistema Operacional Distribui√ß√£o Unix
 - Node vers√£o 16
 - Docker
 - Docker-compose vers√£o >=1.29.2

‚û°Ô∏è O `node` deve ter vers√£o igual ou superior √† `16.15.0 LTS`:
  - Rode os comandos abaixo para instalar a vers√£o correta de `node` e us√°-la:
    - `nvm install 16 --lts`
    - `nvm use 16`
    - `nvm alias default 16`

‚û°Ô∏è O`docker-compose` deve ter vers√£o igual ou superior √†`ÀÜ1.29.2`

</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>üê≥ Configura√ß√£o Docker</strong></summary><br />

  ### Docker e Docker-compose

  ‚ö† O seu docker-compose precisa estar na vers√£o 1.29 ou superior.  ‚ö†

‚ö†Ô∏è **Aten√ß√£o:**

- O arquivo `docker-compose.yml` pode ser utilizado para executar a aplica√ß√£o na sua m√°quina local, para isso √© necess√°rio executar o comando `npm run compose:up` na raiz do projeto.
- Caso voc√™ queira realizar modifica√ß√µes no projeto, prefira o usar o comando `npm run compose:up:dev`, pois diferente do comando anterior este comando est√° configurado para compartilhar volumes com o _docker_, e tamb√©m utiliza o _script_ que realiza o _live-reload_ ao fazer modifica√ß√µes no _back-end_. Somente quando instalar uma nova dep√™ndencia ou alterar algum arquivo na raiz do backend, voc√™ dever√° realizar o re-build do seu compose, pois o volume est√° mapeando somente altera√ß√µes dentro da pasta `src` Voc√™ pode verificar essas configura√ß√µes explorando o arquivo `docker-compose.dev.yml` e comparar com `docker-compose.yml`.

</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Inicializa√ß√£o do compose e verifica√ß√£o dos logs das aplica√ß√µes </strong></summary><br />

- Considerando o uso do par√¢metro `healthcheck` em cada container do seu `docker-compose.yml`, a inicializa√ß√£o dos containers deve aguardar o comando de status de sa√∫de (o que valida se aquele container est√° operacional ou n√£o):
  - No container `db`, representado por um comando `ping` no banco de dados;
  - No back-end, representado por um comando `lsof`, que vai procurar aplica√ß√µes ativas na porta definida (por padr√£o, no caso `3001`);
  - No front-end, representado por um comando `lsof`, que vai procurar aplica√ß√µes ativas na porta definida (por padr√£o, no caso `3000`).

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Ao rodar a aplica√ß√£o no back-end para visualizar o retorno da API, esteja atento a porta, pois a 3001 est√° sendo usada no docker, o que pode ocasionar em conflito, assim apenas mude o valor da porta. Exemplo: `APP_PORT=3003`.

</details>

<details id='Variaveis-de-ambiente'>
    <summary><strong>‚öôÔ∏è Vari√°veis de ambiente</strong></summary><br />

  **No diret√≥rio `app/backend/` configure os valores de acordo com o cen√°rio do seu ambiente (credenciais de banco de dados, secrets desejadas e etc)**. Isso vai permitir que voc√™ inicialize a aplica√ß√£o fora do _container_ e ela se conecte com seu banco local caso deseje.
 > `./app/backend/.env`
  ```txt
  JWT_SECRET=jwt_secret
  APP_PORT=3001
  DB_USER=seu_user
  DB_PASS=sua_senha
  DB_HOST=localhost
  DB_PORT=3306
  ```
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Em JWT_SECRET receber√° como valor a senha do administrador ou do usu√°rio. √â poss√≠vel verific√°-las no diret√≥rio `app/backend/src/database/seeders` na semente que cont√©m o nome `user`.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>üé≤ Rodando a aplica√ß√£o</strong></summary>
<br>

#### **Na ra√≠z do projeto**

    npm install -> instala as aplica√ß√µes front e back.

#### **No Back-end**

    npm run db:reset -> Recria a base de dados.
    npm run dev -> Roda a aplica√ß√£o na porta escolhida por voc√™ na variav√©l de ambiente ou por padr√£o na porta 3001.
    npm run test:coverage -> Mostra a cobertura de testes por arquivo.

‚ö†Ô∏è Quaisquer execu√ß√£o referente ao sequelize-cli deve ser realizada dentro do diret√≥rio app/backend. Certifique-se de que antes de rodar comandos do sequelize j√° existe uma vers√£o compilada do back-end (diret√≥rio app/build), caso contr√°rio basta executar `npm run build` para compilar. O sequelize s√≥ funcionar√° corretamente se o projeto estiver compilado.

#### **No Front-end**

    npm start -> roda a aplica√ß√£o visual para a intera√ß√£o.

</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>üé≤ Mais comandos importantes</strong></summary>

#### **Na ra√≠z do projeto**

- Voc√™ pode **subir ou descer uma aplica√ß√£o do compose**, utilizando `npm run` com os scripts `compose:up`, `compose:down`, ou `compose:up:dev`, `compose:down:dev`;
- Os comando de _compose_ anteriores est√£o configurados para executar o _docker-compose_ com o terminal desanexado (detached mode `-d`). Caso queira acompanhar os logs de um servi√ßo em tempo real pelo terminal, basta executar `npm run logs [nome_do_servico]` onde _nome_do_servico_ √© opcional e pode receber os servi√ßos _backend_, _frontend_ ou _db_;
